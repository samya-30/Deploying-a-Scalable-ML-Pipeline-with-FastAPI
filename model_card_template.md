## Model Details
This model is a Random Forest Classifier trained to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually based on features from the U.S. Census dataset. The features include demographic and employment attributes.

## Intended Use
The model is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the deployment of machine learning models using MLOps tools and best practices. It should not be used for real-world decision-making without further validation and fairness testing.

## Training Data
The model was trained on the Census Income Dataset, which includes over 30,000 records with labeled income brackets (<=50K or >50K). The dataset includes both categorical and continuous variables.

## Evaluation Data
A portion of the dataset (20%) was held out as a test set to evaluate model performance.

## Metrics
- Precision: ~0.82
- Recall: ~0.72
- F1 Score: ~0.76

Model metrics were calculated on the test set. Additional slice-based performance was evaluated for individual demographic groups to check for potential fairness issues.

## Ethical Considerations
The model may reflect historical biases present in the census data, such as socioeconomic disparities based on race or gender. Use of this model in production would require further fairness audits, bias mitigation techniques, and stakeholder consultation.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- This model is not validated for real-world usage.
- Performance may degrade on data distributions significantly different from the training set.
- Retraining and monitoring are recommended if deployed in dynamic environments.
